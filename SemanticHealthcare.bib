Healthcare standards provide the base for interoperability between different Electronic Health Record ({EHR)} system. The problems related to data interoperability arise when two {EHR} system's are complaint to heterogeneous healthcare standards and want to communicate with each other. To achieve semantic data interoperability, there is need to resolve data level heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose system that enable high level of accuracy of mapping between heterogeneous healthcare standards model. The broader goal of data interoperability is achieved when these heterogeneities are resolved through ontology matching and generation of accurate mapping file, that helps in clinical message conversion from one standard to another. To justify claim we investigate {HL7} and {openEHR} standards ontological mappings. We will discuss transformation of {HL7} and {openEHR} models at high level and instance transformation at the realization level. The proposed approach provides accurate mappings that enables timely health information sharing among different healthcare systems to provide better healthcare to patients.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The healthcare industry is rapidly advancing towards the widespread use of electronic medical records systems to manage the increasingly large amount of patient data and reduce medical errors. In addition to patient data there is a large amount of data describing procedures, treatments, diagnoses, drugs, insurance plans, coverage, formularies and the relationships between these data sets. While practices have benefited from the use of {EMRs}, infusing these essential programs with rich domain knowledge and rules can greatly enhance their performance and ability to support clinical decisions. Active Semantic Electronic Medical Record ({ASEMR)} application discussed here uses Semantic Web technologies to reduce medical errors, improve physician efficiency with accurate completion of patient charts, improve patient safety and satisfaction in medical practice, and improve billing due to more accurate coding. This results in practice efficiency and growth by enabling physicians to see more patients with improved care. {ASEMR} has been deployed and in daily use for managing all patient records at the Athens Heart Center since December 2005. This showcases an application of Semantic Web in health care, especially small clinics.},

	abstract = {The global effort in the standardization of electronic health records has driven the need for a model to allow medical practitioners to interact with the newly standardized medical information system by focusing on the actual medical concepts/processes rather than the underlying data representations. An archetype has been introduced as a model that represents functional health concepts or processes such as admission record, which enables capturing all information relevant to the processes transparently to the users. However, it is necessary to ensure that the archetypes capture accurately all information relevant to the archetype concepts. Therefore, a semantic backbone is required for each of the archetype.

In this paper, we propose the development of an archetype sub-ontology for each archetype to represent the semantic content of the corresponding archetype. The sub-ontology is semi-automatically extracted from a standard health ontology, in this case {SNOMED} {CT.} Two steps performed to build an archetype sub-ontology are the annotation process and the extraction process, in which some rules have to be applied to maintain the validity of sub-ontology. The approach is evaluated by utilizing the archetype sub-ontologies produced in the development of a new archetype to ensure that only relevant archetypes can be linked to the archetype being developed, so that the only relevant data are captured using the particular archetype. It is shown that the method produces better results than the current approach in which an archetype sub-ontology is not used. We conclude that the archetype sub-ontology can represent well the semantic content of archetype.},

A location service in {CDN} discovers data of interest in the network at query time. {CDN} uses standard cryptographic techniques to provide security to data providers and protect the privacy of patients. Using {CDN}, a user can pose clinical queries pertaining to cancer containing aggregations and joins across data hosted by multiple data providers. {CDN} is implemented with open-source software for web application development and {XML} query processing.

	abstract = {Objectives
We wanted to develop a method for evaluating the consistency and usefulness of {LOINC} code use across different institutions, and to evaluate the degree of interoperability that can be attained when using {LOINC} codes for laboratory data exchange. Our specific goals were to: (1) Determine if any contradictory knowledge exists in {LOINC.} (2) Determine how many {LOINC} codes were used in a truly interoperable fashion between systems. (3) Provide suggestions for improving the semantic interoperability of {LOINC.} Methods
We collected Extensional Definitions ({EDs)} of {LOINC} usage from three institutions. The version space approach was used to divide {LOINC} codes into small sets, which made auditing of {LOINC} use across the institutions feasible. We then compared pairings of {LOINC} codes from the three institutions for consistency and usefulness. Results
The number of {LOINC} codes evaluated were 1917, 1267 and 1693 as obtained from {ARUP}, Intermountain and Regenstrief respectively. There were 2022, 2030, and 2301 version spaces among {ARUP} and Intermountain, Intermountain and Regenstrief and {ARUP} and Regenstrief respectively. Using the {EDs} as the gold standard, there were 104, 109 and 112 pairs containing contradictory knowledge and there were 1165, 765 and 1121 semantically interoperable pairs. The interoperable pairs were classified into three levels: (1) Level I – No loss of meaning, complete information was exchanged by identical codes. (2) Level {II} – No loss of meaning, but processing of data was needed to make the data completely comparable. (3) Level {III} – Some loss of meaning. For example, tests with a specific ‘method’ could be rolled-up with tests that were ‘methodless’. Conclusions
There are variations in the way {LOINC} is used for data exchange that result in some data not being truly interoperable across different enterprises. To improve its semantic interoperability, we need to detect and correct any contradictory knowledge within {LOINC} and add computable relationships that can be used for making reliable inferences about the data. The {LOINC} committee should also provide detailed guidance on best practices for mapping from local codes to {LOINC} codes and for using {LOINC} codes in data exchange.},

Although {RDF} was proposed as a standard format for the web, these databases are still available in various formats. With the increasing popularity of the semantic web technologies and the ever growing number of databases in bioinformatics, there is a pressing need to develop mashup systems to help the process of bioinformatics knowledge integration. {Bio2RDF} is such a system, built from rdfizer programs written in {JSP}, the Sesame open source triplestore technology and an {OWL} ontology. With {Bio2RDF}, documents from public bioinformatics databases such as Kegg, {PDB}, {MGI}, {HGNC} and several of {NCBI’s} databases can now be made available in {RDF} format through a unique {URL} in the form of http://bio2rdf.org/namespace:id. The {Bio2RDF} project has successfully applied the semantic web technology to publicly available databases by creating a knowledge space of {RDF} documents linked together with normalized {URIs} and sharing a common ontology. {Bio2RDF} is based on a three-step approach to build mashups of bioinformatics data. The present article details this new approach and illustrates the building of a mashup used to explore the implication of four transcription factor genes in Parkinson’s disease.

	abstract = {Scientists and healthcare workers regularly use data from a number of sources as part of their research and professional work. The current mechanisms for providing combined access to multiple datasources are either closed or not easily extensible, with some requiring users to locally load and query each data-source independently. In this work we introduce a new model for transparent querying across multiple datasources which relies on the single unifying format of {RDF} to merge information before returning it to users. The use of normalised, resolvable {URI's}, combined with the {SPARQL} {RDF} query language, enables common queries to be executed across multiple public and private datasources, including those not initially designed or represented using {RDF.} In order to accommodate a range of users, the implemented system has been set up to enable customisation of queries and datasources based on {RDF} formatted configuration files. This breadth of data and configurability allows scientists and healthcare workers to more efficiently find and communicate semantic references, supporting research, professional practice and dissemination of knowledge across communities and disciplines.},

	abstract = {Interoperable health information exchange depends on adoption of terminology standards, but international use of such standards can be challenging because of language differences between local concept names and the standard terminology. To address this important barrier, we describe the evolution of an efficient process for constructing translations of {LOINC} terms names, the foreign language functions in {RELMA}, and the current state of translations in {LOINC.} We also present the development of the Italian translation to illustrate how translation is enabling adoption in international contexts. We built a tool that finds the unique list of {LOINC} Parts that make up a given set of {LOINC} terms. This list enables translation of smaller pieces like the core component “hepatitis c virus” separately from all the suffixes that could appear with it, such {“Ab.IgG”}, {“DNA”}, and {“RNA”.} We built another tool that generates a translation of a full {LOINC} name from all of these atomic pieces. As of version 2.36 (June 2011), {LOINC} terms have been translated into nine languages from 15 linguistic variants other than its native English. The five largest linguistic variants have all used the Part-based translation mechanism. However, even with efficient tools and processes, translation of standard terminology is a complex undertaking. Two of the prominent linguistic challenges that translators have faced include: the approach to handling acronyms and abbreviations, and the differences in linguistic syntax (e.g. word order) between languages. {LOINC’s} open and customizable approach has enabled many different groups to create translations that met their needs and matched their resources. Distributing the standard and its many language translations at no cost worldwide accelerates {LOINC} adoption globally, and is an important enabler of interoperable health information exchange.},

The core of {CMT} is comprised of {SNOMED} {CT}, laboratory {LOINC}, and First {DataBank} drug terminology. These are integrated into a single poly-hierarchically structured knowledge base. Cross map sets provide bi-directional translations between {CMT} and ancillary applications and administrative billing codes. Context sets provide subsets of {CMT} for use in specific contexts. Our experience with {CMT} has lead us to conclude that a successful terminology solution requires that: (1) usability considerations are an organizational priority; (2) "interface" terminology is differentiated from "reference" terminology; (3) it be easy for clinicians to find the concepts they need; (4) the immediate value of coded data be apparent to clinician user; (5) there be a well defined approach to terminology extensions. Over the past several years, there has been substantial progress made in the domain coverage and standardization of medical terminology. {KP} has learned to exploit that terminology in ways that are clinician-acceptable and that provide powerful options for data analysis and reporting.},

Each internet data source is seen as a table, and a mashup is seen as a query on these tables. We assume that web data sources are represented in {RDF}, and {SPARQL} is the query language. We propose a query-by-diagram language called {MashQL.} The goal is to allow people to build data mashups diagrammatically. In the background, {MashQL} queries are translated into and executed as {SPARQL} queries. The novelty of {MashQL} is that it allows querying a data source without any prior understanding of the schema or the structure of this source. Users also do not need any knowledge about {RDF/SPARQL} to get started.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} A key activity for life scientists in this post "-omics" age involves searching for and integrating biological data from a multitude of independent databases. However, our ability to find relevant data is hampered by non-standard web and database interfaces backed by an enormous variety of data formats. This heterogeneity presents an overwhelming barrier to the discovery and reuse of resources which have been developed at great public {expense.To} address this issue, the open-source {Bio2RDF} project promotes a simple convention to integrate diverse biological data using Semantic Web technologies. However, querying {Bio2RDF} remains difficult due to the lack of uniformity in the representation of {Bio2RDF} datasets.
{RESULTS:} We describe an update to {Bio2RDF} that includes tighter integration across 19 new and updated {RDF} datasets. All available open-source scripts were first consolidated to a single {GitHub} repository and then redeveloped using a common {API} that generates normalized {IRIs} using a centralized dataset registry. We then mapped dataset specific types and relations to the Semanticscience Integrated Ontology ({SIO)} and demonstrate simplified federated queries across multiple {Bio2RDF} endpoints.
{CONCLUSIONS:} This coordinated release marks an important milestone for the {Bio2RDF} open source linked data framework. Principally, it improves the quality of linked data in the {Bio2RDF} network and makes it easier to access or recreate the linked data locally. We hope to continue improving the {Bio2RDF} network of linked data by identifying priority databases and increasing the vocabulary coverage to additional dataset vocabularies beyond {SIO.}},

We reviewed the literature on {PHRs} including design, functionality, implementation, applications, outcomes, and benefits. We found that, because primary care physicians play a key role in patient health, {PHRs} are likely to be linked to physician electronic medical record systems, so {PHR} adoption is dependent on growth in electronic medical record adoption. Many {PHR} systems are physician-oriented, and do not include patient-oriented functionalities. These must be provided to support self-management and disease prevention if improvements in health outcomes are to be expected. Differences in patient motivation to use {PHRs} exist, but an overall low adoption rate is to be expected, except for the disabled, chronically ill, or caregivers for the elderly.

For these classifications to be widely used, they must be compatible with the {`International} Statistical Classification of Diseases and related health problems' ({ICD)} of the World Health Organization ({WHO)}, which system is used throughout the world for classification of diseases and reasons of death. The {`Ninth'} revision of the {ICD} ({ICD-9)}, published in 1976, is currently in use in a number of Member States of the World Health Organization, including the United States. However, it is expected that by the end of this decade virtually all Member States will have introduced the 10th Revision of the {ICD} ({ICD-10)}, published in 1992. An {`Application} of {ICD-10} to neurology' ({ICD-10} {NA)} has been developed, with a specific coding system for virtually every neurological disease currently recognized. This article describes the structure and background of this work, that is offered as a definitive international classification of neurological disease to be used by clinical and research organizations, governmental and nongovernmental bodies, and for epidemiological and research purposes. It is concordant with the new and proposed classifications of subspecialty neurological organizations.},

The similarity between procedure models of {SNOMED} {RT} and the {U.K.} s Clinical Terms Version 3 is proving to greatly facilitate the full integration of the two terminologies into a merged vocabulary to be known as {SNOMED} Clinical Terms ({SNOMED} {CT)}, slated to be released in the near future.},

Underlying the {UMLS} effort is the assumption that timely access to accurate and up-to-date information will improve decision making and ultimately the quality of patient care and research. The development of the {UMLS} is a distributed national experiment with a strong element of international collaboration. The general strategy is to develop {UMLS} components through a series of successive approximations of the capabilities ultimately desired. Three experimental Knowledge Sources, the Metathesaurus, the Semantic Network, and the Information Sources Map have been developed and are distributed annually to interested researchers, many of whom have tested and evaluated them in a range of applications. The {UMLS} project and current developments in high-speed, high-capacity international networks are converging in ways that have great potential for enhancing access to biomedical information.},

However, this standard has various problems, mainly its lack of semantic interoperability. This shortfall was addressed in {HL7} Version 3, a newer standard which has been designed to solve this problem. Total semantic interoperability cannot be achieved without defined terminology, and to this end the use of the Systemised Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms ({SNOMED-CT)} is proposed. The difficulty arrives when deciding how to integrate the information model and the terminology. The line between where one ends and the other begins is often indistinct. This paper describes a proposal for normalising the two using ontology mapping and basing {HL7} message models on {SNOMED-CT} concepts and their relationships, in an effort to further total semantic interoperability and seamless communication between healthcare entities.},

Such is the case with cephalometrics – standardized measurements of angles and distances between specified landmarks on X-ray film used for orthodontic treatment planning and a variety of research applications. We describe how we unified the existing cephalometric definitions from 10 existing cephalometric standards to one unifying terminology set using an existing standard ({LOINC).} Using our example of an open and web-based orthodontic case file system, we describe how this work benefited our project and discuss how adopting or expanding established standards can benefit other similar projects in specialized domains.},

The idea that syntax and semantics are independent has been shown to be an oversimplification. We cannot slot any terminology into any data structure and expect it to work. Perhaps, it is surprising that for so many years, so many people thought that we could. After all, in every spoken language, such as English, the grammar (syntax) and words (terminology) have evolved together. For reasons, which seemed good at the time, the standards development organization responsible for healthcare terminologies (such as {SNOMED} {CT)}, message syntaxes (such as the {HL7} V2 and V3) and information models, developed independently and in parallel. The main justification was the perceived need to interoperate with a wide range of legacy schemes and to meet the needs of different national requirements and languages. {SNOMED} {CT} was designed to be syntax-neutral, so it could work with any syntax. Reference models such as the {HL7} {RIM} and {EN} 13606 set out to be terminology-neutral.},
