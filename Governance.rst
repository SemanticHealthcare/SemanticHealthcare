Introduction
============

This document lists the Governance Rules of the Open Source Semantic Healthcare
community. Â These rules follow the agile methodology of open source communities
and are intended to provide guidance and clarity to community members and
supporters.

Governance Principles
=====================

Transparency
------------

The community will adhere to practices of full transparency, by which all
information related to the project will be made publicly available, even as it
is being drafted. All documents, and source code, materials developed by this
community will be made publicly available under permissive non-reciprocal
licenses.

Openness
--------

The community will embrace principles of full Openness. All
practices will be aligned with facilitating the flow of information across all
members. No mechanisms will be adopted that could constrain the flow of
information.

The practice of Open Development will be embraced. This means that source code
and documents will be written on the open as they are being drafted, and that
feedback, contributions, and participation from all will be welcomed during the
drafting, development and maintenance of all materials.

Participation
-------------

The community will be inclusive, and will embrace participation by all.
No rules in the governance and subsequent policies will contain terms that
exclude anyone from participation. Specific rules will be drafted, using the 
model of the Wikipedia, to address Trolling activities in a manner conducive to
convert potential Trolls and vandals into contributors.

The community will maintain a continuous effort to recruit, welcome and
involve new members in the community. The goal is to maximize the
community size in order to take advantage of network effects and economies
of scale that make possible the best benefits of open source
practices and methodologies.

Meritocratic Networked Organization
-----------------------------------

The community will adopt a non-hierarchical Meritocratic governance model. 
Decisions about the directions of the commumity will be made by those who are doing the
work and who are affected by those decisions. The decision making process will be
kept as close as possible to the activities for which those decisions
are relevant.

Agility
-------

The community will embrace practices of Agile development and will use rapid
iterative cycles of light requirements gathering, design, prototyping,
implementation and testing followed by circling rapidly back to revising and adjusting
requirements. This methodology is conducive to large scale participation, and
prevents projects from drifting in divergent directions for long periods of time.
