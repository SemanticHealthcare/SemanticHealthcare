        <p>The goal of this project is to demonstrate a flexible, adaptive means of communicating healthcare information in a form that is suitable for exchange between health care organizations and patients for clinical, research, and evidence-based medical practice, as envisioned by the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST [PCAST2010] ). In 2010, PCAST issued a report entitled “Realizing the Full Potential of Health Information Technology to Improve Healthcare for Americans: The Path Forward” calling for a universal exchange language to improve the quality of healthcare and reduce its cost:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best way to give clinicians a unified, patientcentric record tailored for each medical encounter is to store, maintain, update, and exchange the data as small, distributed, metadatatagged elements”
</p></blockquote>

<p>The report is cautious about relying on a single “standard data model”</p>
<blockquote><p>“We believe that any attempt to create a national health IT ecosystem based on standardized record formats is doomed to failure.&gt; </p></blockquote>

<p>It recommends a language that promotes distributed definition of expression ("a universal exchange language whose semantics is intrinsically extensible") so that the government and others can</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"unburden itself of a potentially never ending and intrusive government role in the harmonization of health record meanings across all private sector products.”</p></blockquote>

<p>On one hand, this call for a metadata-based model is a fundamentally new vision of how we handle health information. On the other hand, it is a confirmation of the approach that has been used successfully for decades in both the VA VistA and the DoD CHCS systems, in the form of a metadata-driven data dictionary system.</p>

<p>This project will demonstrate a working “sandbox” using existing VistA and CHCS data dictionaries to create a hands-on demonstration of a semantic-web approach for a universal health exchange language.</p>

<p>Within this context is the concept of the Nationwide Health Information Network (formerly NHIN, now NwHIN). There are two major aspects of the NwHIN: a nationwide, secure patient data exchange and the implementation of the current “file-transfer motif” methodology. PCAST is skeptical of the current realization saying - “current approaches to [patient] data exchange and aggregation, which are often bilateral or documentbased, do not, in our view, present a clear path to scalable national solutions that would trigger transformative innovation and use of health IT”.</p>

<p>Moving around big blobs of data with a fixed set of standard tags is antithetical to the granular, bottom-up philosophy of the web. We propose technology that follows the guidelines provided by PCAST and that can dramatically improve the goals of NwHIN.</p>

<p>We propose an Open Source project to address healthcare information needs for the first and continuing phases of this effort. Openness is essential for wide adoption of any proposed solution. An open and transparent system builds up a community of users with an investment in cooperation and in problem solving to extend and improve the underlying technology. Combined with an agile development philosophy, these systems allow rapid evolution to meet the true needs of the user community in direct contrast to closed source proprietary systems. As pointed out in the PCAST report, open agile development solves the adoption problem at the same time that it solves the implementation problem. Further, while such a system will undoubtedly interact with other open-source health initiatives including the VA-launched OSEHRA, the system must maintain its own existence as a separate project to ensure independence and wide adoption by multiple interacting communities.</p>

<p>The essential requirements that will allow this universal exchange language to provide a real solution to healthcare challenges are:
● It must be patient-centric. Information must be organized primarily to serve the patient. Information silos, proprietary formats, and limited data transfer are the direct consequence of a focus on vendor and site needs instead of patient needs.
● It must build on existing standards and groups to effectively take advantage of the many years of standardization efforts.
● It must be open and freely available in order to facilitate wide adoption and dissemination, and as far as possible, also be generic to have use outside the healthcare space and be applicable to other fields.
● It must be decentralized to facilitate organic growth and to take advantage of the self-organization behaviors that emerge in large networks. By not having a central head, nor using a top-down approach, the system can evolve and adapt in parallel based on specific user needs at multiple institutions before coalescing into an interconnected system. These characteristics of organic systems have been studied in detail by Ostrom, Nobel Laureate in Economics 2009 [Ostrom2008], and by Benkler in his studies of peer-production economic models in the Information age [Benkler2006][Benkler2011]. They are important components of successful open source projects such as the Linux Kernel [LinuxKernel2012]. The Wikipedia project demonstrates the value of both open source software (Wikimedia), as well as an open community to produce content (Wikipedians and contributors). (See [1] for a conversation between Wiki Inventor Ward Cunningham and Tom Munnecke, discussing the similarities between the Wiki and the VistA architecture.)</p>

<p>This project is timely. The World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) effort to better support fully structured data on the web has introduced a host of approaches (Linked Data / Semantic Web) and technologies (SPARQL, OWL, RDF, Microformats) for fully web-based distributed systems. We believe that this suite of technologies and approaches represent the underpinnings of an NwHIN that meets PCAST’s call. This approach will change the NwHIN’s current implementation. Part of any work must address to what extent and which parts of the current approach can be reused going forward.
Fortunately for the DoD and VA, VistA and variants such as CHCS and RPMS are highly data-centric, making them ideal first candidates for this new data-centric NwHIN. Most of the existing work that we will leverage in bringing EHR’s onto the Semantic Web has been done on VistA, and our development will start there as well.</p>

<p>Our system implementation will be open source; moreover, the process for specifying and prototyping this NwHIN improvement is as important as the software implementation itself and we will use to the extent possible an open, transparent process for the clear promotion and dissemination of design and development decisions. Our process is a reflection of the final product that we want to create.</p>

<p>This proposal team, representing decades of experience in the design, implementation and deployment of Electronic Medical Records; with practical experience in data analytics, languages and Semantic Web technology; and with substantial experience in development and support of large-scale, open-source software, will build a realistic prototype of a universal exchange language suitable for the needs of healthcare applications. Experience indicates that the knowledge on how to create such a prototype is already available and that the real difficulty is centered on converging to and executing a practical implementation with the properties of being: (a) fully open to encourage adoption, and (b) highly scalable, so that it can grow organically by leveraging network effects.</p>
